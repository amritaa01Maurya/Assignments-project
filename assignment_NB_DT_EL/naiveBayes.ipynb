         "Subject: gas prices  vince -  1 . we can detect \" hoarding \" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against  the actual inflow .  2 . we can detect \" market power \" by dissociating the seller from the buyer ,  distinguishing between the physical \" cost \" in gas to run the generators and  the transmission cost in dollars , i . e . the basis .  3 . ( as you noted ) we can detect \" storage \" as the difference between inflow  and consumption .  it appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model  of gas prices : flow rates at interconnects ( from telemetry ) and spot - market  prices . there is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing  capacity , as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts . the dynamics of gas  prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for  the weather , as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors :  hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas . we can \" calibrate \" the  price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage , and the price  elasticities of demand for transmission , as well as the extent of hoarding ,  from the two sets of numbers mentioned : flows and prices . what the basis  trader needs to understand are the incentives , and disincentives , for storage  and capacity - hoarding , in terms of the calibrated price - elasticities , and  each of these are as - if exotic call options at the consumption hub . finally ,  flows are \" explained \" by the model , and can be imputed from prices if  necessary , resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of  the weather .  i believe the problem is quite tractable , and i would like to proceed with a  model .  clayton",

wel | we do know this - the great thing about  investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases in  the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay flat , or deciine  siightly , you will stiil make a very heaithy return . of course , energy  prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year  or so as predicted , meaning the vaiue of eogi ' s assets and earnings  wiil soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wiil be  staggering .  overall , we consider eogi to be one of the last outstanding energy  plays in the oil and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized ,  eogi shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention . we have  identified this discovery for immediate accumulation . eogi ' s oil and  gas reserves are well established and are going into massive  production . early investors wi | | secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in  this area wi | | realiy turn up the heat , causing us to revise our  targets upward in next week ' s builetin .  oi | and gas advisory ( oga ) is not a investment expert . certain  statements contained in this newsletter may be future - | ooking statements within  the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 .  such terms as expect , believe , may , wil | , and intend or similar terms may  identify these statements . past - performance is not an indicator of  future - resuits . this is not an expert to acquire or sel | securities . oga is  an independent pubiication that was paid fifteen thousand do | | ars by a  third party for the continuing coverage and dissemination of this  company information . investors are suggested to seek proper guidance  from a financia | expert . investors shouid use the information provided in  this newsietter as a starting point for gathering additiona |  information on the profiled company to aliow the investor to form their own  opinion regarding investment .  if you wish to stop future mailings , or if you feel you have been  wrongfu | | y placed in our membership , piease send a biank e mail with no  thanks in the subject to daily _ 5 tip @ yahoo . com",

Note that it\\'s the same as in R, but not as in the UCI\\nMachine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.\\n\\nThis is perhaps the best known database to be found in the\\npattern recognition literature.  Fisher\\'s paper is a classic in the field and\\nis referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The\\ndata set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a\\ntype of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the\\nlatter are NOT linearly separable from each other.\\n\\n.. dropdown:: References\\n\\n  - Fisher, R.A. \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\"\\n    Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936); also in \"Contributions to\\n    Mathematical Statistics\" (John Wiley, NY, 1950).\\n  - Duda, R.O., & Hart, P.E.
